# 👋 Welcome to Ians-lab 🧪💻

This is the official space for **Ians-lab** — a creative coding playground where experimentation comes first.

Whether it’s useful, weird, educational, wild, or just for fun — if it involves **code, tools, apps, or ideas worth trying**, you’ll find it here.

## 🚀 What I do here
Here at **Ians-lab**, I explore:
- 🧠 Playful coding experiments
- 🛠️ Prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- 🤖 AI-assisted tools and scripts
- 🔍 New frameworks, libraries & workflows
- 📦 Random builds that *might* be useful  
(and sometimes ones that are just for fun)

This space is all about learning, tinkering, and pushing things a little further.
